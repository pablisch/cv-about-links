          <h2>The creation of March Wood</h2>
          <!-- <p>When my primary school decided they would like to offer Forest School, I was aksed to look into the feasibilty of this with a mandate to 'make it happen'.</p>
            <p>Despite being far outside my knowledge or comfort zone, I was excited to take on this challenge and so started a four year journey of planning and implenting all aspects of Forest School including the </p> -->
          <p>
            The largest barrier to setting up Forest School at my primary school
            was the profound lack of trees so I planted a brand new baby
            woodland that become known as March Wood. There were no end of
            challenges including funds and resources, unmoveable deadlines, the
            reality of how long natures take to grow what you want as well as
            how quickly it grows what you definitely do not want, and helping
            saplings survive the long, hot summer holidays when the school is
            closed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took passion, dedication and resilience, espically in the midst
            of the pandemic lockdowns, but March Wood has thrived, tiny saplings
            now tower over me and we have an amazing outdoor classroom for all
            the school to enjoy.
