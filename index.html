            Following a lifelong passion for making and crafts, I took a degree in Furniture Design and Craftsmanship on the renowned Buckinghamshire New University course in High Wycombe. Following a few years working in professional craft workshops making one-off pieces for clients such as David Linley and Lily Curtis, I spent a decade as a self-employed furniture maker on a range bespoke projects for lovely artists, musicians and other creatives, such as Nigel Godrich, Garth Jennings and Joby Talbot.

            The urge to create has never left me and spills out into carving, book-binding, small sculptural pieces and into the digital world.
