# CV About Links - More About Me

## Getting Started

2. `cd` into the directory
3. `open index.html` to open the app in your browser

## Description

This is a quick webpage made as an addition to my CV to give some context to comments about myself for anyone that wishes to know a little more.
It was based upon an earlier project of mine, [Knot Very Useful](https://github.com/pablisch/knot-very-useful), which was a simple app to display a range of panelTopics and their descriptions.

Screenshot of the navbar, app knot selection and descriptions:

The app itself shows a range of panelTopics in the navbar and the same range displayed as tiles. Beneath the tiles is a video display window that can be used to play a video of the currently selected knot.

Hovering over either the knot tile or the navbar link will display a description of the knot. Clicking on either the knot tile or the navbar link will make the screen scroll smoothly down to the video window and display the video of the knot being tied.

## Technologies Used

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## The app in action

As a little extra playful touch, all panelTopics fade to description and the title turns green when you hover over the navbar app logo.
